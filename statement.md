# Project: Teacher's Gradebook

## 1. Problem Statement
Teachers have to manually calculate student marks by hand. This takes a lot of time and often leads to calculation mistakes. Teachers need a simple and automated way to manage student grades without using pen and paper.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project is a CLI Python-based tool designed to make grading easier. It allows a teacher to select a student, calculate their total marks and average, and decide if they pass or fail automatically. It also helps in visualizing the data using graphs.

## 3. Target Users
* **School Teachers:** Who need to generate report cards quickly.
* **Tutors:** Who manage small groups of students.

## 4. High-Level Features
* **Secure Login:** The system is protected by a password so only the teacher can access it.
* **Class Roster:** Displays a list of all students in the class.
* **Report Card Generator:** Automatically calculates the Total, Average, and Grade (S, A, B, etc.) for any student.
* **Pass/Fail Check:** Automatically checks if a student has passed based on their marks.
* **Data Visualization:** Creates a bar chart to show how a student performed in different subjects.
